Hello there , My name is Budwell ... I like to write code , learn new things , dig into technology and generally random things that pass through my unorganised brain.

I have always wanted to organise my thoughths and put them down somewhere, generally that has been my notes mac notes app , then obsidian and sometimes its just pieces of paper. But somedays the ideas I write are soo cool that I think of sharing  with others, for the most part I don't because I ask myself ...What if I am wrong? They probably know this already ... and the final one , Someone has already written about this. 

For the first time I am doing it differentyly, I will write for me to come back and look at later and if someone has talked about already maybe I will say it differently and someone will benefit.

I like talking about music (as in musical instruments)
I read a lot (well sometimes I just listen to books)
I enjoy learning in general (Currerntyly I sm learning go lang)
